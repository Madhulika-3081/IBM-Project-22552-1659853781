Statistical Machine Learning Approaches to Liver Disease Prediction

Liver diseases avert the normal function of the liver. Mainly due to a large amount of alcohol consumption liver disease arises. Early prediction of liver disease using classification algorithms is a productive task that can help doctors to diagnose the disease within a short duration of time. Discovering the existence of liver disease at an early stage is a complex task for doctors. The main objective of this project is to analyze the parameters of various classification algorithms and compare their predictive accuracies to find the best classifier for determining liver disease.

This Project examines data from liver patients concentrating on relationships between a critical list of liver enzymes, proteins, age, and gender using them to try and predict the likeliness of liver disease. Here we are building a model by applying various machine learning algorithms to find the best accurate model. And integrate into Flask-based web applications. Users can predict the disease by entering parameters in the web application.
