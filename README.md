<u><b>Statistical Machine Learning Approaches to Liver Disease Prediction</u></b> - Madhulika I and Kavya AP

üìä **Introduction:**
Liver diseases disrupt the normal functioning of the liver, often resulting from excessive alcohol consumption. Early prediction of liver disease through classification algorithms is a valuable tool for doctors, facilitating swift diagnoses. Detecting liver disease in its early stages is a complex challenge for medical professionals. This project aims to analyze various classification algorithms, assess their predictive accuracies, and identify the best classifier for early liver disease detection.

üìë **Data Analysis and Objective:**
In this project, we scrutinize data from liver patients, focusing on the interplay of vital liver enzymes, proteins, age, and gender. These parameters are used to predict the likelihood of liver disease. Our goal is to construct a robust model by implementing a range of machine learning algorithms, with the aim of finding the most accurate predictive model.

ü§ñ **Machine Learning Implementation:**
We employ multiple machine learning algorithms to create and evaluate predictive models. By applying these algorithms to the dataset, we aim to determine the optimal model for liver disease prediction.

üåê **Web Application Integration:**
To make this predictive tool accessible to users, we integrate the best-performing model into a Flask-based web application. Users can conveniently input their relevant parameters into the application for liver disease prediction.

This project combines statistical machine learning techniques, data analysis, and web application development to enhance the early detection of liver disease, providing a valuable resource for medical professionals and individuals concerned about their liver health.
